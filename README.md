<p align="center">Easily and securely transfer stuff from one computer to another.</p>

*croc* is a tool that allows any two computers to simply and securely transfer files and folders. There are many tools that can do this, but afaik *croc* is the only tool that is easily installed on any platform *and* has secure peer-to-peer transferring *and* has the capability to resume broken transfers. 

## Overview

*croc* uses "code phrases" to securely transfer files. A code phrase is a combination of three random words (mnemonicoded 4 bytes) which the sender shares with the recipient. The code phrase is used by the sender and recipient for password authenticated key exchange ([PAKE](https://github.com/schollz/pake)) to validate parties and generate a secure session key for end-to-end encryption. Since a code phrase can only be used once between two parties, an attacker has a chance of less than 1 in *4 billion* to guess the right code phrase to steal the file. Any attacker with the wrong code phrase will fail the PAKE and the sender will be notified. Only two people with the right code phrase will be able to computers transfer encrypted data through a relay.

The actual data transfer is accomplished using a relay, either using raw TCP sockets or websockets. If both computers are on the LAN network then *croc* will use a local relay, otherwise a public relay is used. All the data going through the relay is encrypted using the PAKE-generated session key, so the relay can't spy on information passing through it. The data is transferred in blocks, where each block is compressed and encrypted, and the recipient keeps track of blocks received so that it can resume the transfer if interrupted.

My motivation to write *croc*, as stupid as it sounds, is because I wanted to create a program that made it easy to send a 3GB+ PBS documentary to my friend in a different country. My friend has a Windows computer and is not comfortable using a terminal. So I wanted to write a program that, while secure, is simple to receive a file. *croc* accomplishes this, and now I find myself using it almost everyday at work. To receive a file you can just download the executable and double click on it (sending a file requires opening a terminal still, though).

## Examples

The first example shows the basic transfer of some file or folder from computer 1 to computer 2. _These two gifs should run in sync if you force-reload (Ctl+F5)_

![send](.github/1.gif)

![receive](.github/2.gif)

The second example shows how you can restart a broken transfer. Here, computer 2 presses Ctl+C during a transfer to abruptly break the connection, and then resumes by having computer 1 re-send the file. _These two gifs should run in sync if you force-reload (Ctl+F5)_

## Install

[Download the latest release for your system](https://github.com/schollz/croc/releases/latest).

Or, you can [install Go](https://golang.org/dl/) and build from source with `go get github.com/schollz/croc`.


## Usage 

The basic usage is to just do 

```
$ croc send FILE
```

to send and then on the other computer you can just do 

```
$ croc [code phrase]
```

to receive (you'll be prompted to enter the code phrase). Note, by default, you don't need any arguments for receiving, instead you will be prompted to enter the code phrase. This makes it possible for you to just double click the executable to run (nice for those of us that aren't computer wizards).

### Custom code phrase

You can send with your own code phrase (must be more than 4 characters).

```
$ croc send --code [code phrase] [filename]
```

### Use locally

*croc* automatically will attempt to start a local connection on your LAN to transfer the file much faster. It uses [peer discovery](https://github.com/schollz/peerdiscovery), basically broadcasting a message on the local subnet to see if another *croc* user wants to receive the file. *croc* will utilize the first incoming connection from either the local network or the public relay and follow through with PAKE.

You can change this behavior by forcing *croc* to use only local connections (`--local`) or force to use the public relay only (`--no-local`):

```
$ croc --local/--no-local send [filename]
```

### Using pipes - stdin and stdout

You can easily use *croc* in pipes when you need to send data through stdin or get data from stdout. To send you can just use pipes:

```
$ cat [filename] | croc send
```

In this case *croc* will automatically use the stdin data and send and assign a filename like "croc-stdin-123456789". To receive to stdout at you can always just use the `-yes` and `-stdout` flags which will automatically approve the transfer and pipe it out to stdout. 

```
$ croc -yes -stdout [code phrase] > out
```

All of the other text printed to the console is going to `stderr` so it will not interfere with the message going to stdout.

### Self-host relay

The relay is needed to staple the parallel incoming and outgoing connections. The relay temporarily stores connection information and the encrypted meta information. The default uses a public relay at, `ws://198.199.67.130:8153`. You can also run your own relay, it is very easy, just run:

```
$ croc relay
```

Make sure to open up TCP ports (see `croc relay --help` for which ports to open). Relays can also be customized to which elliptic curve they will use (default is siec).

You can send files using your relay by entering `-relay` to change the relay that you are using if you want to custom host your own.

```
$ croc -relay "ws://myrelay.example.com" send [filename]
```
